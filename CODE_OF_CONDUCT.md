# Code of Conduct for One Small Step

## Our Pledge

We as contributors, maintainers, and community members pledge to make participation in **One Small Step** a respectful, inclusive, and compassionate experience for everyone, regardless of mental health status, disability, age, body size, visible or invisible difference, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to building a project that embodies the values of recovery: **hope, self-determination, inclusion, respect, and empowerment.**

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior.  
They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (GitHub discussions, issues, pull requests, documentation) and in public spaces when someone is representing the project or its community.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue on GitHub.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  
Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of reporters.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will use the following community impact guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** – A private, respectful message identifying the concern and a request for behavior change.  
2. **Warning** – A formal warning about continued unacceptable behavior.  
3. **Temporary Ban** – A period of time during which the contributor loses collaboration privileges.  
4. **Permanent Ban** – Long-term removal from the community for repeated or severe violations.
