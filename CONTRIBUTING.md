   - “Technical or accessibility suggestion”
4. Write a short explanation (2–3 sentences) of what you’re suggesting and why it helps.

If you’re familiar with GitHub Pull Requests:

## 🧭 Guidelines for Cards

Please keep each card:
- **Short and clear** — one idea per card.
- **Gentle and nonclinical** — no medical advice, no promises of cure.
- **Actionable** — something that can be done in a few minutes or inspires a next small step.
- **Respectful and inclusive** — accessible to people of different backgrounds and experiences.
- **Cited or linked** — include one or two trustworthy sources when possible.

Good example:
> *“Write three things you’re grateful for. Be specific, not grand. (‘The coffee was hot.’ ‘My cat sat next to me.’)”*

Not a good example:
> *“Try this supplement or medication.”*
